## Secondary Dominant Chords

**In a minor key, are i and iv diatonic or chromatic?**
- They are diatonic! They show up naturally in minor keys. If we were to have a iv in a major key, that would be a chromatic chord. Any chord that is modified from how it would appear naturally in the major or minor key is chromatic.

**A standard progression: I - vi - ii - V - I (in C)**
- Remember: fa does *not* always go to mi. In this progression, if you have F and G in the alto voice for ii and V, fa should go to sol. This is because in circle-of-fifths progressions, thirds always resolve up to the root of the next chord.

**Altering ii - V**
- The mystery chords are V and I in G major. All we did was alter the key signature for the second two chords. The key signature is a stand-in for adding an accidental (raised third) to ii.

**Changing ii to a dominant chord**
- In order to get the same effect we got in the last example, we need to add an accidental. Raise the third in ii to get...a V/V! This is called *tonicization*.
 - Tonicization = extending harmony to treat any non-tonic chord as a tonic. Another way to think of this is just us temporarily creating a tonic. Remember, V/V - V movement is really just V - I in the key of V.
- Slashes below the staff = "x **of** x." Slashes above the staff = "x **over** x." It can be confusing, but try not to mix them up! Remember that Roman numerals label function, whereas chord symbols label the actual notes within a chord.
- Unlike tertiary function chords, secondary dominants *replace* function, rather than extend/embellish it. I6/4 is always paired with V because it extends dominant function, but V/x is always paired with x because we are temporarily going to x's key area. One way to remember this is that we are temporarily phasing over to a *secondary* key.

**Do not** tonicize ii0 in minor or vii0 ever. There is no diminished key and trying to do this for our part writing in this class is a bad idea. However, in analyses later in the semester you might see a composer do this because the Romantic period was really crazy.

**Secondary dominant seventh chords (same progression as before, but with ii7)**
- This process is the same as for turning a regular ii into a V/V, but we end up with a V7/V instead!
 - *How do I tell what inversion a secondary function chord is in?*: The inversion figures will always be attached to the Roman numeral to the left of the slash, as seen with V7/V. They go with the "upper" Roman numeral because the "lower" one is just a shorthand for a key in relation to the key we are already in.
- As we'll see in coming lectures, this process can used to tonicize any major or minor triad.

**How do we determine V/V in different keys?**
- Literally ask "what is the V of V" and go from there
- These chords are weird and require added accidentals so double-checking (or even triple-checking) them is always a good idea!! Make sure what you ID'd matches up with what you wrote out in the staff.
