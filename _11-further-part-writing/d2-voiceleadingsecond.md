# Class Discussion

**There are four types of second inversion chords:**
- Cadential
- Passing
- Pedal
- Arpeggiated

**Doubling rules:**
- Double the bass! In this case, that would be the fifth of the chord. Doubling the root is possible, but more difficult than doubling the fifth

**Cadential 6/4 chords**
- I6/4 will ALWAYS come before V(7). V(7) must be in root position because the bass movement must be static between the two chords. I6/4 - V(7) - I gives us a very smooth soprano line, but in order to do that there needs to be a common tone in the bass at some point
- I6/4 has dominant function because it extends V(7)

**Passing 6/4 chords**
- I - V - ii6/4 - V6 - I
  - Whenever you have a passing chord, its "primary function" becomes that of the chords around it, no matter was Roman numeral it is. In this example, ii6/4 has a dominant function because it acts as part of the V's around it
  - Their tertiary function is basically just to act as a bridge between other chords--to make voice leading easier. We wouldn't have been able to set up our cool contrasting motion soprano and bass in this example without the passing 6/4 in the middle

**Pedal 6/4 chords**
- Centered around the idea of the pedal tone, whereas a passing chord is defined by (majority) passing motion
- How to differentiate a pedal chord from a pedal non-chord tone: if the bass is a chord member, it's a pedal chord! If it isn't, it's an NCT
- Static motion in perfect octaves is a PP8...unless it's a pedal
- Just like cadential and passing chords, these chords extend the harmonies on either side of them
