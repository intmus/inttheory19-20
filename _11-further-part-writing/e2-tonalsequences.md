# Class Discussion

***Melodic sequences***

**Diatonic vs. chromatic**
- Diatonic is entirely in the key. The first example is completely in C, so it's diatonic. When a sequence is diatonic you don't label the quality of the interval of transposition because it will vary between each scale degree
- For chromatic sequences, you have to label the interval *with* its quality because that determines the "key"
- Always be thinking about the smallest possible pattern to identify! In example 4, the sequence can technically be a whole beat *or* half a beat. However, it is suggested to ID it as being half a beat because that's simpler (especially if you're expected to write out the rest)

**Ascending vs. descending**
- Intervals within the pattern will be ascending or descending, but the only thing we care about is the interval transposition, or the *overall* motion between each sequence. The second example is a descending sequence because the overall transposition is down by a second

Some sequences will have qualities of diatonic and chromatic sequences. Ex. 5's inner intervals are fixed, the same as in a chromatic sequence, but the interval of transposition is a "diatonic third," descending in thirds down the C major scale.

**How to label sequences:** put a bracket over the top of the areas you want to ID as a sequence, then draw arrows pointing from the one on the left to the one on the right. Over the top of the arrow, indicate whether it's ascending/descending with an up or down arrow, and also include a number (and quality, if the sequence is chromatic) to ID the interval of transposition.

***Harmonic sequences***

**A two voice sequence**
- Is this example functional? Can you harmonize the example (come up with a progression for it)? Can we have a cadence as we normally would?
- Sequences don't have to follow functional tonal harmony rules, which is why it's okay for us to have a V6/4 as our penultimate chord in this example. It's like how passing chords don't have to follow circle-of-fifths progression rules, except it's all the time
- Adding the alto voice
  - This also ends up being a sequence! From the second measure, the pattern is down a third + up a second, or an overall transposition interval of a second


**Common sequences**
- Parallel 6 chords
  - Made entirely of first inversion chords. Goal is a smooth + strong bassline
  - Always descending
- Pachelbel's sequence
  - Suuuuuuuper prevalent, you hear it everywhere
  - This is the reason we have iii -> IV in our chord progression chart! This progression works in Pachelbel's Canon in D and is used widely even today
