title: Discussion 3c - Leadsheet Notation

### Class Discussion

**Definitions of new/unfamiliar terms for leadsheet notation:**
- Sub: taking one note out of the chord and replacing it with another. Ex. D11 (sub #11)
- Add: adding extra notes to the chord. Ex. Ab7 (add 4)

How we're "supposed" to interpret leadsheet notation can change depending on the composer. One might not care whether you interpret C^11 as adding an 11th or a 4th, whereas others will *specifically* want an 11th because of how its sound differs from a 4th

**What is the difference beteen an add 6 chord and an inverted minor seventh chord? (Ex: C^6 and Am7/C?)**
- This is the point where roman numeral analysis becomes more useful! Leadsheet notation = construction, roman numeral analysis = finding function. The two chords have vastly different functions even though they contain the same notes and are shaped in the same way

**What do we sub out in a sub chord?**
- Whatever is closest! Ex: C (sub 6) replaces the 5th with the 6th

**Why is leadsheet notation important for our class?**
- Another way of organization?
- Understanding a chord can be more than one thing?
- Figured bass purposes?
- Easily understandable without having to bring tonality into it
  - Yes! Roman numerals rely on context, but leadsheet notation doesn't.

#### Lead-sheet symbols

A triad can be summed up by a single symbol, such as a lead-sheet chord symbol. A lead sheet symbol includes information about both root quality, as well as which pitch class occurs in the lowest voice (called the *bass* regardless of who is singing or playing that pitch).

A lead-sheet symbol begins with a capital letter (and, if necessary, an accidental) denoting the root of the chord. That letter is followed by information about a chord’s quality:

-   major triad: no quality symbol is added
-   minor triad: lower-case “m”
-   diminished triad: lower-case “dim” or a degree sign “°”
-   augmented triad: lower-case “aug” or a plus sign “+”

Finally, if a pitch class other than the chord root is the lowest note in the chord, a slash is added, followed by a capital letter denoting the pitch class in the bass (lowest) voice.

A C-major triad’s lead-sheet symbol is simply **C**. A C-minor triad is **Cm**. A D-sharp-diminished triad with an F-sharp in the bass is **D\#dim/F\#**. And so on.
